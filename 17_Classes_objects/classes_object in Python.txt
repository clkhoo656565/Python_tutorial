1. Python is an object oriented programming language
	- almost everything in Python is an object
	- str(), int(), .... are the constructor functions

2.Class
	- class is the blueprint of the User
	- Class is like an object constructor
	- all classes have a __init__() function
	- __init__() is executed automatically, whenever we create the objects from this class
	- Functions inside the class also call as METHOD

3. Objects
	- every object belongs to its class
	- collection of various data and functions that operate on those data
